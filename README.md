In **date & time** mode you can make date time calculations. For example, let's say you want to know how much time it is 13800 seconds minus 10000 milliseconds. You can use autocomplete for selecting time units like in the image below.

Here you can also make date time calculations. Let's say today is 4 of April 2020. What is the date after 90 days. It is 3 of July 2020.

## Yet another calculator. Why?
I find the tools that I use frustrating and not functional enough. 
For example Windows 10 has a great calculator. It has more functionality than this one. I definetely inspired by it.
- But you can not copy paste whole strings to it.
- Let's say I did a long calculation like `2^4-145+4*23`. Why I can't change 145 to 146?
- I really like button pressed effect on screen keyboard. But there is a small glitch which I found bit annoying. When I press a button conitiounly It is not shown pressed contiously, there is a small glitch.

I used google as calculator a lot. You can copy-paste text and change the string from the middle of it. But When I changed angle unit to degree why the results aren't changing.

</p>

I also used duckduckgo a lot. It wasn't good with trigonometic functions either.

I hope this tool would be handy and useful for people.
